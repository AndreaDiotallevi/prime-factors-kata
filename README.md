# The Prime Factors Kata

This repository contains a test-driven development implementation of the [prime factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_prime_factors) kata algorithm, with JavaScript and the Jest testing framework.

I have also written a related [article](https://www.andreadiotallevi.com/blog/how-to-incrementally-develop-an-algorithm-using-test-driven-development) on my website, which explores the fundamental components of test-driven development, with a test by test guide on how to incrementally develop an algorithm using the TTD cycle.

The article and the algorithm development closely follow [this](https://vimeo.com/97516288) fascinating talk by Robert C. Martin, aka Uncle Bob, which inspired me to thoroughly master the underlying concepts behind test-driven development.
